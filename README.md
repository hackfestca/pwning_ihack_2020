### IHack 2020 pwning challenge by salt

## Introduction

The Ihack CTF is a hacking competition organized 6 months before the Hackfest. This competition wants to be accessible to all levels. For more details, you can see the official website: [https://ihack.computer/](https://ihack.computer/)

For the 2020 edition, I created a track on Linux binary exploitation (pwning) like the last year. The difference is the binaries are in 64 bits.

You can find the write-ups on my [blog](https://www.salt-hacking-blog.com/2020/06/09/Ihack-2020-pwning-challenges-reloaded.html):

You can set up the challenges following the instructions below.

## Dependencies

You need to install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

With apt-get, you need to install the following packages:

```bash
apt-get install xinetd
```

## Installation

After you clone the depot, you just need to launch the start.sh file (you need to be root).
